## Sending funds to crowdloan contributors for Centrifuge
### March 2024

The `getUniqueAddresses.js` script is designed to fetch unique addresses from Centrifuge's subscan API. It queries for an initial transfer previously done on-chain to all crowdloan contributors where 0.001CFG was sent. The script tries to cincumvent Subscan limitations on API requests/s and max_pages by querying for the remaining block numbers once limits are reached.
Once all unique addresses are collected, they are saved to a JSON file named `uniqueAddresses.json`. 
It's important to note that an API key is required for the requests, which needs to be added where `'YOUR_API_KEY'` is mentioned in the code. A free subscription is enough.

The `sending.js` script is used to send transactions to a list of addresses. It loads the unique addresses from the `uniqueAddresses.json` file generated by the `getUniqueAddresses.js` script. For each address, it creates and signs a transfer transaction using a specified amount and sends it. The script logs the details of each transaction, including any errors, to both the console and a log file named `transactions.log`. To use this script, a connection to the Centrifuge blockchain is established, and a seed phrase for the sender's account must be provided where `'YOUR_SEED_PHRASE'` is mentioned.

Both scripts require the addition of sensitive information before use:
- The `getUniqueAddresses.js` script needs an API key to be added.
- The `sending.js` script requires a seed phrase to sign transactions.
